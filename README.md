## Pricing Strategies

Common approaches to pricing MCP server tools:

| Strategy               | Description                                          | Best For                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Per-call flat rate** | Fixed price per tool invocation (e.g., $0.01/call)   | Simple tools with consistent compute cost         |
| **Per-token metered**  | Price based on input/output token count              | LLM-wrapper tools, text processing                |
| **Tiered pricing**     | Different price tiers based on volume                | High-volume enterprise users                      |
| **Freemium**           | Free credits on signup, paid after threshold         | Growing user base, low-friction onboarding        |
| **Dynamic pricing**    | Price adjusts based on complexity or demand          | Variable-cost tools (API aggregators, search)     |
